    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Making a Website.</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:5px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p> This week, I learned how to make my own website for digital fabrication. Here is where I'll be posting all my future projects and work I do in Daigital Fabrication.</p>
    <p> The website is a crucial step in this cource and to make it, I used a variety of sources and information which helped me understand the basics of htm coding and VSC.</p>
    <p> The first step was to create an account with <a href= "https://github.com/"> Github,</a> which gave me access to the html coding software. this allowed me to be able to create a website from scratch, using the given commands and operations.</p>
    <p> Once I had an account, I loaded up my repositories which I had previously saved on my computer and added them to VSC which opened a terminal. I started working on developing my html code here.</p>
    <p> I visited <a href= "https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp"> W3 School's website</a> to find an appropriate template to help me with my website. I chose this template because it had a very easily accessible sidebar, along with a very simplistic design shaped by colours which I really like.</p>
    <p> Once I chose the template, I edited the code and previously existing details on the template. I changed them to what was needed on my website. The images were changed, some of the code was, and lastly, I added the titles for all the other weeks where I will be administering additional projects and the processes I used to complete them.</p

    <p>The first task in the Digital Fabrication course</p>
    <p>We were tasked with making our own website this week in order to upload all our forthcoming assignments on this website. Initially, I didn't know anything about coding, but slowly learned to code with the help of VSC (Visual Studio Code) and 
    <a href= "https://generalassembly.wistia.com/medias/x8e1j7uuet">General Assembly.</a></p>
    <p> Step 1- I visited <a href="https://mkdunaway.github.io/"> Madison's Website</a> and saw the videos needed to start the introduction to digital fabrication. From here i picked up information on how to use my terminal to access VSC and install <a href"https://brew.sh/"> homebrew</a> which helps with missing packages on macbook.</p>
    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WrvZtQxAbuMKChJrtae_Xm1y9mhhWt3zf7no-QMFhtAePZ7m9nkpqBW1VCO6U9o77LAvGAwtr6OjMpwKAfvPR-JQjOEwCNBgPxoX5wQcHjUFqqHRfvdy5gv6xYRUA_ax1HM55M_a=w2400" style="width:50%" alt="homebrew"
   <br>
    <p>Step 2- After installing homebrew, I shifted my focus to adding my repository I made from the terminal, onto VSC (Visual Studio Code). Once my repository was added here on VSC, I was able to begin to html code the repository into a fully functioning website.</p>

  <p>Step 3- After these steps were cleared, I moved on to find a template of a website which I could use from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp"> W3 School's web</a> and chose this template. I input my code and made changes for the website to look and suit my needs.</p>

  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>More on html and css.</b></h1>
  <p>html which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language is the coding language used in majority of websites to render pages and results on the world wide web (WWW.). 
    the few common uses of html are: 
    <ol>
      <li>web development</li>
      <li>Internet navigation</li>
      <li>web documentation</li>
          </ol></p>
          <p>html is very similar to text, except that html uses special characters such as <, >, /, :, and ". When a certain letter or letters are input between these symbols,
          it can form a function/hyperlink which can be used on a website. This can help a person navigate the website from their side. When combined with CSS, and Java, 
          an individual can produce an extremely complex yet promising website or software.</p>
            <p> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is another form of code which works in harmony with html. Both these softwares are simply the backbone of many websites, if not all.
              As most websites are text-based, these two play a big role in showcasing the website. CSS is rule-based coding. What that means, is that you could use this code to 
              declare a font for your website. You could set the font size and the colour of it too.</p>
              <br>
        <p> Here is an example of what CSS can look like in simple code. 
          <br>

  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Cloning in Coding.</b></h1>
    <p> Cloning in coding is a very useful method of correction in code. Usually what happens in code, is that sometimes we copy and paste code we have used in the terminal
      to save time from rewriting it again. this process can be justified by the elements ( and ). Any portion of code which is input between these two brackets will be cloned and can save 
      a lot of time that would have been dedicated to rewriting the whole code.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here is an example of how cloning can work.</p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Understanding Git.</b></h1>
       <p>Git is a free and open ended software which handles multiple projects of various size related to coding and website-making. It is a relatively simple skill to learn
         yet, it is extremely powerful, fast, and leaves a tiny digital footprint.</p>
       <br>
       </p> The way that git works can be understood as efficient and safe. When code is typed into a git repository, it can be in 3 different states:
    <ol>
      <li>modified</li>
      <li>staged</li>
      <li>comitted</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In a modified state, the contents of the file (the code) are being modified, but only in the working directory. These changes are yet to be saved and committed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In a staged state, the changes in the files are moved to the staging area in the software. Git will see that these changes are to be a part of the next commit (save).
      <br>
      <p>Finally, in the committed state, the files are saved, committed and sent to the website. This save will dsiplay your changes on the website or server. These changes are
         reversible by simply making a new change in the file and repeating this whole process all over again.

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
     <p> The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.
       It's the counterpart to git fetch, but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches. 
       Remote branches are configured using the git remote command. Pushing has the potential to overwrite changes, caution should be taken when pushing.</p>

          alt="gitpush" style="width:40%">
     <br>
     <p>The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
        Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows.
        The git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands, git fetch followed by git merge.
        In the first stage of operation git pull will execute a git fetch scoped to the local branch that HEAD is pointed at.
       Once the content is downloaded, git pull will enter a merge workflow.</p>

    <p>In week 2, I was assigned the task of completing the CNC Routing assessment. We were tasked with making a wooden desk organiser by using the Shaper Origin
     tool to cut and shape a plank of birch wood from scratch. With the likes of
       <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html?sdid=KKQML&mv=search&ef_id=CjwKCAjw7fuJBhBdEiwA2lLMYeLllp_PQBWOCERWHVFrcR-KXg93jyliO-NUa_3F_j9eJpXtlCVnzxoCnsQQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!442365417815!e!!g!!adobe%20illustrator!1711729586!70905759510&gclid=CjwKCAjw7fuJBhBdEiwA2lLMYeLllp_PQBWOCERWHVFrcR-KXg93jyliO-NUa_3F_j9eJpXtlCVnzxoCnsQQAvD_BwE">Adobe Illustrator,</a> 
      and <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal">Fusion360. </a></p>
      
    <p>The initial step of Week 2 was to watch the videos on <a href="https://mkdunaway.github.io/WeeklyAssignments/Week05_SubtractiveManufacturing.html"> Madison's Website</a> to get
        an idea of what was going to done this week.</p>
   
    <p> We used a tool called the shaper which was used to cut and carve the wooden plank. This is a form of subtractive manufacturing. Mainly because we're taking away from the 
      material provided and subtracting it to produce a finished product.</p> 
   
    <p> In the next step, I downloaded fusion360 and started making a design from scratch. I used the tutorials on Madison's website to help me with the process of creating the design.
       We had to make a design in length of 12.5 inches and height of 8.5 inches. The thickness of the board was 0.75 inches.</p>
    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wDqehJTcpWHmeoQICsaDL0_vTD_uKO4Y_EDwDQBR6XYShnt6a32p3XmDu-ZDKZ7KQ3UeFTy1AIw6m6xPAc-gU9hV_57xNhXPH_bYDWmQ52wHsoj01X3HxeT50zw4S-8shFKLcqAJHw=w2400" 
         alt="fusion360design" style="width:40%">
        <br>
         <p> This was the initial design after using the rectangle tool to draw a rectangle of the given lengths. Next, we were told to make at least 4 other
    depressions in the board for our own items which we will be storing in the board. This is where I measured my lens solution bottle's diameter, my fans remote, 
    my digifab training pass, and my phone. I added these depressions so the board can hold these items.</p>
   
    <p> The outer sharp edges would be unsafe to leave outside incase it scratches me or I brush past it so I decided to remove them. I labeled the outside as body 1
      and hid it in fusion 360 to get a gist of what the board would look like.</p>

      alt="fusion360design2" style="width:40%">
   
    <p> Once these steps were done, I used the render option on fusion360 to add a little depth to my design by giving it the thickness and turning it into a 3d model. This was to
      see if my design will turn out the way I expect it to.

           <br> 
     
    <p> I added the cherry wood effect on the board to help give it some authenticity and view it just to see how it will turn out. Since I was going to remove the sharp
         edges, I further hid body1 to get the clearest image of how my design was going to look.</p>

         <br>
   
    <p> This was the final 3D design that I created. It was ready to go so I converted it to .dxf and saved it to my Digital Fabrication folder.</p>
   <br>
      <p> The only slight setback which I encountered, was that I didn't have access to Adobe Illustrator as IT services hadn't given me an account. For that reason, I
         have only a few more images while using Illustrator as they were taken from the lab computer. Once I gain access, I can load my file and add the images later.</p> 
    <p>The third step was to get my training of the Shaper out of the way, and begin preparing the product.</p>
    <br>
   
    <p> The next step was to input the .dxf file into Adobe Illustrator so that the image can be converted to .svg and the correct designing for origin colours are used.</p>
    <br>

          alt="designingfor origin" style="width:40%">
    <br>
    <p> Once I had imported my design onto Ai, I used the designing for origin template to strike out what type of cuts I needed on my board. The grey fillings cut pockets. 
      This is what I required for making compartments and my initals. Hence they are grey. The black filling helps with telling the shaper to not cut the blacked
       out area. I also went on to delete my outer border as that was not going to be part of ther final product.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qeAShy7WkFE3Bwbx6fuvssIduoPA5_L3ILNeFcdfNWQczdLymbRvvlF7DO8HkvoABCvkXKiIPV5hE8KvhHzkgh-oc0DoC2FBjNcO0uJHmw_yQS7a6_GUpRQioR4D4WfmY6gTrcFrdQ=w2400"
          alt="svgorganiser2" style="width:40%">
    <br> 
    Moving ahead, I imported my file from fusion360 onto the lab computer and had to rearrange my compartments as they were not leaving enough space for each other
     on the board. Once I was satisfied with my design, I started to fill in the type of cut I needed for each of my compartments.</p>

      <p> The shaper is a tool used to shape wood and styrofoam. Using different drill heads can give varying results on the wooden board (I used the wooden board).</p>
    <p> These are the steps taken to use the shaper in the lab:
      <ol>
        <li> Rollup sleeves, tie hair, remove any wristwear to prevent drill injury</li>
        <li> Wear eye and ear protection</li>
        <li> Turn on the power</li>
        <li> Use the vacuum to get rid of the previous person's debris</li>
        <li> Take your plank and secure it to the workspace with 2 nails and double-sided tape (nails need to be flush with the wood)</li>
        <li> Use the shaper to scan the workspace as a new design.</li>
        <li> Load up your .svg file in the shaper</li>
        <li> Make sure to notify everyone in the lab that there will be a lot of noise</li>
    </ol>

          alt="workstation" style="width:40%">
  </p>
  <p> The shaper uses two drill bits. First, it uses the v-bit. The v-bit is a thin drill bit used for engraving or writing. The other tool is the 1/4" downcut flat end mill.
    This is used for making the pocket cuts in the board, or deep cutting. </p>
    <br>

    <p> Origin uses computer vision to understand its location relative to a workpiece. 
      Its precision motors fine-tune the router spindle’s position in real time using sophisticated sensing and control algorithms that keep you accurate to within 1/100th of an inch of your intended path. 
      If you stray outside of Origin’s correction range, the cutter automatically retracts, protecting your workpiece. Think of Origin as auto-correct for your hands.</p>
  </p>
  
  <p> My initial cut was to remove the border. I drilled .25 inches the first way round, then .50 and moved on to fill the pockets. I believed that 
    it would save time to drill the final piece as that would detach the entire board. </p>

  <p>This week, we focused on FDM printing which is 3D printing. 3D Priniting is a form of additive manufacturing. This means that we create an object by not taking away 
    from the material being used.</p>
    <p> An FDM (fused deposition modeling) printer is a 3D printer that is often used in early concept development and prototyping for medical device design.
      FDM refers to how the 3D model is formed.
      The material (molten plastic) is deposited by a three-axis system in single layers, and multiple layers fuse together to form the 3D model.</p>
    <br>

         alt="prusa1" style="width:40%">
    <br>
   
    <p> The process begins with a 3D CAD (computer-aided design) model. Slicing software divides the digital model into numerous slices (layers) and outputs a G-code file for the printer. 
      The FDM printer heats solid plastic filament, and melts and extrudes it from a nozzle — layer upon layer — onto a build tray to form the 3D object. 
      Each layer can be 0.1mm to 0.5mm thick based on the desired resolution.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
   
    <p> The <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/"> Prusa Slicer </a> is a software which is used to transfer files into the .gcode format so that
       the files which we want to print can be converted into a language which the printer can understand and render a print.</p>
   
    <p> The user must first load a .stl file onto the program. This is a type of 3D file of what the user might be trying to print. Once the file is loaded
       on, we can use the prusa slicer to change the size, infill, and adjust the supports required to print the object (if needed).</p>
   
    <p> The objects size can be adjusted in mm or inches. This is if the object doesn't fit the printer bed size or to reduce the print time.</p>
   
    <p> The infill stnads for the amount of internal strength your object will have. Infill determines the strength of your object as the printer will focus on how much 
      PLA will be used to help form an internal structure, like a skeleton for the object.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qksJTogMBnMZ7H9e6bq8G4iuXIegsF-V_Tfcg6xDVBFrb2BLdnqnYMiZpa9SNMKe6cfSW7QoKoCZkUZDBv7anDmKM923-PCBUXYH0CJLkvp37DuH93w4HFMgJWL_BWGoq_PYX0_ZBA=w2400"
          alt="infillpercentage" style="width:40%">
    <br>
   
    <p> Supports play a great role when we print an object which has overhangs. Over hangs are parts of a print that go beyond the centre of mass of the object. 
      This means that the printer will be going against gravity to print this part with no support below it to print. Hence, the use of supports helps crete that extra
       bit of flooring for the overhang so that the print doesn't fail.

  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Fusion360.</b></h1>
  <hr style="width:5px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
      
    <p> Fusion360 is a 3D Modelling software from which you can generate .stl files by designing your own objects. In this week, I was tasked with designing
       a cup for the board which I had created in Week 2. For this, I had to revisit fusion360 to create this item.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AfTkcrsmwH9c_YQhdpAWT2TgxcsZs2FKTRGcTPnVZ86Do7fNv966NJc-uh2O1aMTqWB9YXoENKVvGMWexdGgocTY3-3aZUXoQoDgM0IzeocjIVExVQhjAkm-AbtjT3tx6uLwh0lqMQ=w2400"
       alt="fusion360cup" style="width:40%">
      <br>
      <p>I started off by taking the measurements of the gap which I had left for the cup to fit in. I created a circle to recreate the slot in which my cup will fit perfectly.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Once that was done, I lifted the cup by .25 inches as thats how deep the circular cut was when I used the shaper. I went on to lift the cup .25 inches, while
       leaving the outer circle of the cup to stay the same depth. This way it should slip right into the slot.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jEMgEAl1uH_npfXjpCyN2uap7JeTl6HkUSjGd49O2tceHtPrR3UIiMEPjCei863CIZCtr_Sxy66lX3FuG4ZYPSbZTUMrlGi5S7ZWpFGP2tGxWwG6zh1tCtcHi9zEuB3RMKdudsOfEw=w2400"
          alt="fusion360cup2" style="width:40%">
    <br>
    <p> I then proceeded to add 2 more planes a few millimeters above each other to give my cup height. I made the middle plane ring a little smaller than the above
       ring so that I can get a vase-like figure for my cup. I was designing my cup to hold my desk stationery and thought that a vase figure would suit the purpose
      the best.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UDyq6zjQP0zqst7DHEcwHoMLPsurwitRKR-giixwOEdl12Ii_pyDf5i4gNAdwyy4NOXVBOhl8t7LJJP2WR7kBc-jbKVW7Z-1Rd0gIhdQPVuBi49mhOQIhvFWfxxTxM_3-DOHrTXm6Q=w2400"
          alt="fusion360cup3" style="width:40%">
    <br>
    <p> Once all the planes fit, I joined them to look like a vase. Now, the only thing left was to add a hollow space on the inside so that it could function
       as a cup. For that, I selected the topmost circular plane and deleted it to reveal a hollow inside of the cup. The cup was ready to be printed, but i hadf to add 
      a form of design as a decoration.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uHHw9I9yIhN4u408Vyh2s5q0F0LOGz3bNedOcaSqUZrGN18BTPQDXRkUWlZLRayBSJRLpZWYvsQvf74ID8Wxtf5raIU-iO2_t7JnvomwHBCaiyHmCnOmKSo_gf4oYKUnP_yZLMVPqg=w2400"
         alt="fusion360cup4" style="width:40%">
    <br>
    <p> As fusion360 didn't have the design I wanted, I saved my file as an .stl and exported it to <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard">Tnkercad.</a>
       Tinkercad helped me invert the diamond object and use them as studs on the side of the cup which looked really good. Once I was done adjusting and aligning
       my cup, I saved the .stl file and exported it to Prusa Slicer on the imac at the lab and printed it.</p>
